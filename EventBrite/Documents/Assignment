Hi Zakk,

My name is Trevor Morgan, and I work closely with both Sean and Jenna. I have good news! I received positive feedback from your call with Sean and we would like to continue moving you forward in our interview process! The next step is to ask you to complete this mobile homework assignment below:

Write a simple iOS application which uses the Eventbrite search API (http://developer.eventbrite.com.) 

It should accept a keyword and a location, and display the results on a list or map view. It should use Core Data to import, cache, and display search results. We recommend including a README file that explains any technical trade-offs or decisions you made while building the app.

Bonus points for using any iOS 7 features, designing the app with localization in mind, and writing a few unit tests.

a. Background App Refresh
b. Airdrop
c. Maps wayfinding
d. Custom UIView
e. Controller Transition

If you have any questions with the assignment, please email Sean directly at seanc@eventbrite.com. When you are done, please email the final version to both Sean (seanc@eventbrite.com) and me (trevor@eventbrite.com). If we can have the assignment complete no later than noon PDT on Monday, October 7th, that would be great!

Please confirm that you received this email and that you intend on completing the assignment. I will also let Jenna know to reach out and schedule an on-site interview. We require that your homework be due at least 24 hours before your scheduled interview, so please keep that in mind when you give Jenna your availability.

Cheers,
Trevor Morgan
